<strong>Project Overview</strong>
<br>
<br>
CalmConnect is a single-page web application (SPA/SPWA) with real-time features designed to address mental health challenges, particularly academic and social stresses. The application aims to provide a supportive and accessible platform for individuals seeking mental health resources and assistance. By leveraging emerging technologies such as real-time communication and data analytics, CalmConnect offers features like personalized support, proactive stress management, and a safe, stigma-free environment. The goal is to bridge the gap between individuals and mental health care, promoting early intervention and reducing the stigma associated with seeking help.
